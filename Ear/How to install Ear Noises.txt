#I would recomend a clean install.

#Use the raspberry pi imager.( https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ ) It makes getting the correct image easier also lets you preconfigure wifi & ssh

##These instructions make the assumption that the default username of 'pi'
##will be used. Adjust accordingly. 


#I would do most of this from SSH, aside from copying the file

#setup needs
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

#this will take a hot min; go get some tea, and a sandwhich...depending how far out of date it is
#but need the full update to pull latest python dependices, it took mine around ~30-45mins
#but im using a cheap SD card

#This is optional but HIGHLY recomend doing it if you haven't ran
#these in awhile. It helps with stability issues!
sudo rpi-update
sudo reboot

#before we install libraies we need to create a python enviorment
#because that is just how it is now. :)

#make sure you are in home
cd
python -m venv earnoise
source earnoise/bin/activate

sudo apt install libportaudio2
sudo apt install i2c-tools

pip3 install librosa

#These should have gotten installed from librosa
pip3 install sounddevice
pip3 install soundfile
pip3 install numpy

pip3 install rpi.gpio lgpio gpiozero adafruit-circuitpython-seesaw

#incase the single line does not work
pip3 install rpi.gpio
pip3 install lgpio
pip3 install gpiozero
pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-seesaw


(scan i2c: sudo i2cdetect -y 1)
#regular ol' setup
sudo raspi-config
set audio to audiojack (system options)
enable i2c in interface options
add any extra interface options (VNC)
change hostname

#this you could VNC into to copy off of a drive

copy audio_player.py to Documents (this ensures it works with the venv)

#we are going to make a .bashrc file later
#this will auto run commands as soon as the pi user
#logs into shell, we are going to set it to autologin
#this also disables the desktop but can always be changed
#but it can always be chagned back to autologin desktop

set to autologin as pi to CLI (in System Options)

#all done, leave raspi-config but do not reboot if asked

#will setup autoboot next & set our usbdrive 

#prereq
#USB Format Fat/Fat32
#the USB name needs to be AUDIO (I am not sure this actually matters)
#All files must be WAV 
#Expects 6 audio files located in ./
#we can lower or increase that number, but will need to update dance.py
#it is expecting the name format '1.wav' , '2.wav', etc...
#We are going to manually mount it so it always is in the same location

#plug in USB if you didn't do that yet

cd
lsblk

#this is just to confirm the USB is 'sda'
#I am going to assume it is
#if it isn't change it to whatever matches(sdb, sdc, etc)

sudo mkdir /media/pi/AUDIO
#if you used the USB labeled audio this folder will already exist
#but do both steps anyways
sudo mount /dev/sda/media/pi/AUDIO

#now to run our commands at bash login (shell, since we don't need the graphical overhead)
cd
sudo nano .bashrc

#add these lines to the end of the file

#this always mounts USB to the same file location
sudo mount /dev/sda /media/pi/AUDIO

#This activates python venv & boot script
#this will also ensure if we SSH into the term
#we will always enter the python venv and can just install and adjust
source /home/pi/earnoise/bin/activate
python3 /home/pi/Documents/audio_player.py

ctrl + X to leave
Y & Enter to save

#now everthing should be set, but we need to wire
#eveything up!

#shutdown
sudo shutdown -s now

#boot with USB in plugged in

After full boot..

# It should responde to button presses at this point. Give it about a min to boot. 

# IF NOTHING HAPPENS!!! We need to login VIA ssh and the script will start and instantly output any errors
# Then we will go from there!

## if you login and the lasst line of the error is GPIO busy, it means its already running.
